# Introduction

The American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet dataset, a collection of images representing hand gestures corresponding to the 26 letters of the English alphabet, from A to Z, is not just a dataset for machine learning. It's a powerful tool for developing algorithms that can recognize gestures and translate sign language. In this assignment, you will harness the potential of the ASL Alphabet dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. The goal is to accurately classify these hand gestures into their respective letters, a task that has significant real-world applications in sign language translation and communication.

# Objective

The primary goal of this assignment is to familiarize students with:

● The ASL Alphabet dataset.

● Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch.

● Training and optimizing the CNN model to achieve higher accuracy on the ASL Alphabet dataset.

# Dataset Description

The ASL Alphabet dataset comprises images representing hand gestures corresponding to the 26 English alphabet letters in American Sign Language (ASL). The dataset comprises 26 classes, each representing a unique letter from A to Z.
