# Medical Cost Dataset

The Medical Cost Dataset contains demographic and health-related features of patients, such as age, BMI, smoking habit, number of children, region, etc., along with their corresponding medical costs.

## Attributes

● Age: Age of the patient (years)

● Sex: Gender of the patient (male or female)

● BMI: Body mass index

● Children: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance

● Smoker: Smoking habit of the patient (yes or no)

● Region: Geographic region of the patient (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)

● Charges: Medical costs incurred by the patient

## Objective

The objective of this dataset is to perform a regression task to predict the medical costs incurred by patients based on their demographic and health-related features.


## Tasks

1. Data preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, handle missing values, normalize/standardize features if necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of features, correlations, etc.


3. Feature selection/engineering: Select relevant features and/or create new features if needed.

4. Model selection: Experiment with various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-squared).

6. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune the parameters of the best performing model.

7. Final model selection: Select the best model based on evaluation results.

8. Model interpretation: Interpret the results and understand the factors influencing medical costs.
