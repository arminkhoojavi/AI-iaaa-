Diabetes Dataset

Description:
    The Diabetes Dataset contains various health-related features of patients, such as glucose
    levels, insulin levels, BMI, age, etc., and a binary target variable indicating whether the patient
    has diabetes or not.

Attributes:
    ● Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
    ● Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
    ● BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
    ● SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
    ● Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    ● BMI: Body mass index ( )
    ● DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores
    likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
    ● Age: Age of the patient (years)
    ● Outcome: Target variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

Objective:
    The objective of this dataset is to perform a classification task to predict whether a patient has
    diabetes or not based on the given health-related features.

Tasks:
    1. Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize/standardize features if necessary.
    2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of features, correlations, etc.
    3. Feature selection/engineering: Select relevant features and/or create new features if needed.
    4. Model selection: Experiment with various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
    5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
    6. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune the parameters of the best performing model.
    7. Final model selection: Select the best model based on evaluation results.
    8. Model interpretation: Interpret the results and understand the importance of features in predicting diabetes.
